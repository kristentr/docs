description: "Verify application behavior, extract data, and validate test conditions using assertions and variables"
---

Verify application behavior and extract data for comprehensive test validation and dynamic test flows.

## Assert

**Description**: Verify expected conditions

Validates that specific conditions are met on the page. Can check element visibility, text content, element states, and other page conditions.

**Examples:**
- Assert that 'Welcome' text is visible
- Verify login button is enabled
- Check that error message appears

---

## Extract Information

**Description**: Get data from elements and store it into a variable

Extracts text, attributes, or other data from page elements and stores them in runtime variables for later use in the test flow.

**Examples:**
- Extract user name from profile page
- Extract savings value

---

## Use Variable

**Description**: Use a previously extracted variable

Inserts the value of a previously extracted information or a global variable into the current test flow. Use `\{\{variable:<name_of_variable>\}\}` to use a global variable or `\{\{key:<name_of_variable>\}\}` to use a runtime variable (a value extracted during the test execution).

**Examples:**
- Input `\{\{variable:<name_of_variable>\}\}` on text field
- Insert `\{\{key:<name_of_variable>\}\}` in input

---

## Wait/Wait Until

**Description**: Wait for a specific time or condition

Pauses test execution for a specified time or until a condition is met. Useful for handling dynamic content or animations.

**Examples:**
- Wait 2 seconds for page to load
- Wait until loading spinner disappears
- Wait for element to become clickable

---

## Use Component

**Description**: Insert a test component

Inserts reusable test components that encapsulate complex interaction sequences. Use the 'Import component' button in the interactions bar to select within your available components.

---

## Variable Types

### Global Variables
- **Format**: `\{\{variable:<name_of_variable>\}\}`
- **Use case**: Predefined values like test credentials, URLs, or configuration data
- **Scope**: Available across all tests

### Runtime Variables  
- **Format**: `\{\{key:<name_of_variable>\}\}`
- **Use case**: Data extracted during test execution
- **Scope**: Available within the current test run

## Usage Tips

- **Assertions**: Add assertions after every critical action to catch issues early
- **Data extraction**: Extract dynamic content like user IDs, session tokens, or generated values
- **Variable naming**: Use descriptive names for variables to improve test readability
- **Wait conditions**: Use conditional waits instead of fixed delays when possible
- **Component reuse**: Create components for common workflows like login or checkout

## Common Patterns

### Login Validation
1. Input credentials
2. Click login button
3. Assert welcome message appears
4. Extract user name for later use

### Dynamic Content Testing
1. Extract current value from element
2. Perform action that should change the value
3. Assert new value is different/correct

### Form Validation
1. Input invalid data
2. Submit form
3. Assert error message appears
4. Assert form is not submitted

### Component-Based Testing
1. Use login component
2. Navigate to feature being tested
3. Use feature-specific component
4. Assert expected outcomes
