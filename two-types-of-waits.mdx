# Two Types of Waits: When to Use Each

## The Two Approaches

You know you need waits. But Autonoma gives you two ways to wait:

**Conditional waits**:
```
Wait until: Products load
```

**Fixed time waits**:
```
Wait 3 seconds
```

Both make your test pause. But they work completely differently. And choosing the wrong one can make your tests slow, flaky, or both.

This guide shows you exactly when to use each—and why one should be your default 95% of the time.

## Conditional Waits: The Smart Wait

When you write:
```
Wait until: Products load
```

Here's what Autonoma does:

1. **Check**: Are products loaded?
2. **No**: Wait 100ms, check again
3. **Still no**: Wait 100ms, check again
4. **Yes**: Proceed immediately to next step
5. **Timeout**: If products don't load within a reasonable navigation time, fail the test

**Key insight**: Autonoma doesn't wait a fixed amount. It waits *only as long as necessary*.

**Fast load (500ms)**: Test waits 500ms, then continues
**Slow load (2 seconds)**: Test waits 2 seconds, then continues
**No load (timeout)**: Test fails with clear error

This is smart waiting. The test adapts to actual load times.

## Fixed Time Waits: The Dumb Wait

When you write:
```
Wait 3 seconds
```

Here's what Autonoma does:

1. Pause for exactly 3 seconds
2. Proceed to next step

**Doesn't matter if**:
- The page loaded in 200ms (test still waits full 3 seconds)
- The page isn't loaded after 3 seconds (test proceeds anyway and fails)

This is dumb waiting. The test doesn't adapt to reality.

## The Difference in Action

Let's see both approaches in a real test:

**Using conditional wait**:
```
Test: "View products"

1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/products
2. Wait until: Products load ← Smart wait

- Fast network: Loads in 300ms, test waits 300ms
- Slow network: Loads in 2s, test waits 2s
- Broken page: Doesn't load, test fails with "timeout"
```

**Using fixed time wait**:
```
Test: "View products"

1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/products
2. Wait 2 seconds ← Dumb wait

- Fast network: Loads in 300ms, test waits full 2s (1.7s wasted)
- Slow network: Loads in 3s, test waits only 2s, then fails (not enough time)
- Broken page: Waits 2s, tries to proceed, fails with confusing error
```

**Conditional waits adapt. Fixed waits don't.**

## When to Use Conditional Waits (95% of the Time)

Use conditional waits for anything that depends on loading or state changes:

**After navigation**:
```
1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/checkout
2. Wait until: Checkout form loads
```

**After clicking buttons**:
```
1. Click "Add to Cart"
2. Wait until: Cart badge updates
```

**After form submission**:
```
1. Click "Submit"
2. Wait until: Success message appears
```

**After filtering or searching**:
```
1. Type "laptop" in search
2. Wait until: Search results display
```

**After any API call**:
```
1. Click "Load More"
2. Wait until: Additional items appear
```

**For element visibility**:
```
Wait until: Modal dialog appears
Wait until: Error message displays
Wait until: Loading spinner disappears
```

**For content changes**:
```
Wait until: Order status changes to "Shipped"
Wait until: Balance updates
Wait until: Profile picture changes
```

**The rule**: If you're waiting for something to happen, use a conditional wait.

## When to Use Fixed Time Waits (5% of the Time)

Use fixed time waits only for these specific scenarios:

**Animations that don't affect state**:
```
1. Click "Add to Cart"
2. Wait until: Cart badge updates ← Conditional wait for state
3. Wait 1 second ← Fixed wait for badge animation to finish
4. Take screenshot ← Now animation is complete
```

**Deliberate pacing for visual clarity**:
```
1. Complete form
2. Wait 2 seconds ← Let user "see" the completed form in test video
3. Click "Submit"
```

**Known rate limits or delays**:
```
1. Submit API request
2. Wait 5 seconds ← API has known 5-second processing time
3. Check result
```

**Debugging timing issues**:
```
1. Click "Submit"
2. Wait 3 seconds ← Temporary: helps you see what's happening
3. Verify result
```

**Notice**: These are edge cases. Most tests never need fixed time waits.

## The Performance Difference

Let's compare test execution time with both approaches.

**Scenario**: Your app has variable load times:
- Homepage: 200-800ms
- Product page: 300-1200ms
- Checkout: 500-1500ms

**Test with conditional waits**:
```
1. Navigate to homepage
2. Wait until: Homepage loads (200-800ms)
3. Click "Products"
4. Wait until: Products load (300-1200ms)
5. Click first product
6. Wait until: Product page loads (300-1200ms)
7. Click "Add to Cart"
8. Wait until: Cart updates (100-400ms)
9. Navigate to checkout
10. Wait until: Checkout loads (500-1500ms)

Total: 1400-5100ms (adapts to actual load times)
```

**Same test with fixed time waits**:
```
1. Navigate to homepage
2. Wait 1 second (always 1000ms, even if loaded in 200ms)
3. Click "Products"
4. Wait 2 seconds (always 2000ms)
5. Click first product
6. Wait 2 seconds (always 2000ms)
7. Click "Add to Cart"
8. Wait 1 second (always 1000ms)
9. Navigate to checkout
10. Wait 2 seconds (always 2000ms, but might need 2500ms)

Total: Always 8000ms (wastes time, might fail if loads take longer)
```

**Result**: Conditional waits are faster on average AND more reliable.

## Combining Both Wait Types

Sometimes you need both in sequence:

```
Test: "Verify animated success message"

1. Click "Submit"
2. Wait until: Success message appears ← Conditional: Wait for element
3. Wait 1 second ← Fixed: Let animation complete
4. Take screenshot ← Now animation is done
5. Wait until: Success message disappears ← Conditional: Wait for auto-hide
```

This pattern is common:
1. Conditional wait for state change
2. Fixed wait for visual effect
3. Conditional wait for next state

## Writing Good Conditional Waits

Your conditional wait descriptions should be clear and specific:

**Good conditional waits**:
```
Wait until: Products load
Wait until: "Add to Cart" button appears
Wait until: Cart badge shows "1"
Wait until: Success message displays
Wait until: Loading spinner disappears
Wait until: Error text is visible
```

**Vague conditional waits**:
```
Wait until: Page loads ← Too vague, which page?
Wait until: It's ready ← What is "it"?
Wait until: Done ← Done with what?
```

**The key**: Be specific about what you're waiting for. Autonoma's AI will interpret your description and check for that condition.

## Scrolling + Waiting

Autonoma has a special wait type for scrolling:

```
Scroll until: "Load More" button appears
```

This combines scrolling with waiting—it scrolls down repeatedly until the condition is met.

Use this when:
- Content loads as you scroll (infinite scroll)
- Element is below the fold
- You need to trigger lazy loading

```
Test: "Find product in infinite scroll"

1. Navigate to products page
2. Wait until: Initial products load
3. Scroll until: Product titled "Laptop Pro 2024" appears ← Scrolls + waits
4. Click on "Laptop Pro 2024"
```

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Using fixed waits for loading**
```
Bad:
1. Navigate to /products
2. Wait 3 seconds ← Fixed wait for loading

Good:
1. Navigate to /products
2. Wait until: Products load ← Conditional wait
```

**Mistake 2: Not waiting at all**
```
Bad:
1. Click "Submit"
2. Verify success ← Might fail, no wait!

Good:
1. Click "Submit"
2. Wait until: Success message appears
3. Verify success
```

**Mistake 3: Waiting too short with fixed waits**
```
Bad:
1. Click "Load More"
2. Wait 1 second ← Might not be enough

Good:
1. Click "Load More"
2. Wait until: New items appear ← Adapts to actual load time
```

**Mistake 4: Stacking unnecessary fixed waits**
```
Bad:
1. Navigate to page
2. Wait 2 seconds
3. Wait 1 second
4. Wait 3 seconds
5. Click button

Good:
1. Navigate to page
2. Wait until: Page loads
3. Click button
```

## The Default Choice

When in doubt:

**"Should I use a conditional or fixed wait?"**
→ **Conditional.**

**"But I'm not sure what condition to check for..."**
→ **Describe what should be visible or loaded. Autonoma's AI will interpret it.**

**"What if the condition never happens?"**
→ **The test will timeout and fail—which is correct! Your app has a problem.**

**"But what if I just want to wait 2 seconds to be safe?"**
→ **That makes your test slower and doesn't guarantee safety. Use a conditional wait.**

Conditional waits should be your instinct. Fixed waits should be deliberate exceptions.

## What's Next

You now understand the two types of waits and when to use each. Combined with the previous guide on why tests fail, you have a complete mental model for handling timing in tests.

Next, let's explore another common source of test brittleness: how you select elements to interact with.
