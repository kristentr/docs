# Running Tests

Once you've created and saved your tests, you have three flexible ways to execute them:

## On-Demand Execution

The simplest way to run a test is **on demand**. Perfect for:
- Testing recent changes
- Debugging issues
- Quick verification

Just click the **Run** button in the Autonoma UI to execute immediately and see real-time results.

## Scheduled Runs

Set up **automatic scheduling** for continuous monitoring:
- **Hourly**: Critical flow checks
- **Daily**: Important feature validation
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive regression testing
- **Monthly**: Full end-to-end validation

Ideal for ongoing stability monitoring and catching regressions over time.

## API Integration

Run tests **programmatically** for full CI/CD automation:
- Integrate with any CI/CD platform
- Trigger tests from deployment pipelines
- Automate quality gates
