---

## Random Generator

**Description**: Generate random data

Creates random values for testing purposes including numbers, strings, emails, and other data types.

### ![Random Generate Gif](https://cdn.autonoma.app/interaction-gifs/interaction-random-min.gif)

**Examples:**

**Examples:**
- Scroll down to footer
- Scroll to specific section

---

## Scroll with Condition

**Description**: Conditional scrolling

Scrolls based on specific conditions, such as scrolling until an element becomes visible or a certain condition is met.

### ![Scroll Until Gif](https://cdn.autonoma.app/interaction-gifs/interaction-scroll-until-min.gif)

**Examples:**
- Scroll until 'Load More' button appears
- Scroll down until specific text is visible

---

## Set Camera

**Description**: Configure camera settings

Sets up camera permissions and configurations for testing camera-related functionality.

- Upload document for verification

---

## Variable Management

**Description**: Manage test variables

Create, update, and use variables throughout your test execution for dynamic testing scenarios.

**Examples:**
- Store user input in variable
- Use variable in form fields

---

## Wait Until

**Description**: Wait for conditions

Pauses test execution until specific conditions are met, ensuring proper timing and synchronization.

### ![Wait Until Gif](https://cdn.autonoma.app/interaction-gifs/interaction-wait-until-min.gif)

**Examples:**
- Wait until page loads completely
- Wait for API response to complete

---

## Generate Retriever Email

**Description**: Generate a temporary email to retrieve information like OTP codes

Generates a temporary email address to receive emails for testing purposes. Useful for retrieving OTP codes or verification links during tests. The generated email will be stored in a runtime variable called 'generated_email' for later use.

**Examples:**
- Generate a random email to receive an otp

---

## Retrieve Email Information

**Description**: Get information from received emails

Retrieves specific information from emails received at a previously generated temporary email address. Can extract OTP codes, verification links, or other data from the email content. Make sure to generate the email first with the 'email-information-retriever-generator' interaction. The retrieved information will be stored in a runtime variable called 'email_retrieved_information' for later use.

**Examples:**
- Extract six digit code from latest email
- Get verification link from received email

## Advanced Testing Patterns

### API Integration Testing
1. Create fetch script in settings
2. Use Fetch interaction with script name
3. Assert API response data
4. Extract values for subsequent tests

### Email Verification Flow
1. Generate retriever email
2. Use generated email in registration form
3. Submit registration
4. Retrieve email information (OTP/verification link)
5. Use extracted information to complete verification

### Infinite Scroll Testing
1. Scroll with condition until specific content appears
2. Assert content is loaded
3. Extract pagination information
4. Continue scrolling if more content expected

### Complex Form Workflows
1. Fill initial form data
2. Use fetch to validate data against API
3. Conditionally scroll to reveal additional fields
4. Complete form based on API response

## Usage Tips

- **Fetch scripts**: Set up API endpoints and authentication in the scripts settings first
- **Email testing**: Allow sufficient time between email generation and retrieval
- **Conditional scrolling**: Use specific, unique text or elements as scroll targets
- **Variable management**: Track generated emails and extracted data with descriptive variable names
- **Error handling**: Add assertions to verify API responses and email retrieval success

## Prerequisites

### For Fetch Interactions
- Configure fetch scripts in application settings
- Set up authentication headers if required
- Define request/response handling logic

### For Email Testing
- Ensure email generation completes before attempting retrieval
- Account for email delivery delays in test timing
- Use descriptive extraction patterns for reliable information retrieval

## Runtime Variables

These interactions create specific runtime variables:

- **generated_email**: Created by Generate Retriever Email
- **email_retrieved_information**: Created by Retrieve Email Information
- **Custom variables**: Created by fetch scripts based on API responses

Use these variables in subsequent interactions with the `\{\{key:variable_name\}\}` syntax.
