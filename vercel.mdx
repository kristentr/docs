## Overview

The Vercel integration enables seamless testing of your Vercel deployments. When you connect your Vercel projects to Autonoma, we automatically create the necessary infrastructure to run tests on every deployment.

## How It Works

### Application and Version Creation

When you connect a Vercel project to Autonoma:

1. **Application Creation**: We create an application in Autonoma corresponding to your Vercel project
2. **Version Management**: For each Vercel target (production, preview, development), we create a separate application version

This structure allows you to manage and test different deployment environments independently.

### Deployment Checks

Each time you deploy to Vercel, Autonoma automatically:

- Creates a **deployment tag** for your project
- Runs all tests associated with that tag
- Reports results back to Vercel as deployment checks

<Warning>
**Test Run Consumption**: Each deployment check consumes test runs. If you have 5 tests configured for your project, each deployment will consume 5 test runs (1 per test).

## Authentication Setup

### Vercel Protection Bypass

If your Vercel project uses [Vercel Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection), you'll need to configure the bypass header so Autonoma can access your deployments for testing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate Your Bypass Header">
    Navigate to your Vercel project settings and find your Protection Bypass for Automation secret.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure in Autonoma">
    Add the bypass header to your test configuration in Autonoma.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The bypass header should be added in the format: `x-vercel-protection-bypass: your-secret-value`

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tests aren't running on deployment">
    Ensure that:
    - Your Vercel project is properly connected
    - Tests are tagged correctly for the deployment environment
    - You have sufficient test runs available in your plan
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    Verify that:
    - The bypass header is correctly configured
    - The bypass secret hasn't been rotated in Vercel
    - The header format matches Vercel's requirements
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing deployment checks">
    Check that:
    - The Autonoma integration has proper permissions in Vercel
    - Webhook configurations are active
    - Your application versions are correctly mapped to Vercel targets
  </Accordion>
