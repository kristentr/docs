## Interaction Categories

### 🖱️ Navigation & Movement
Navigate through your application, interact with elements, and control page flow.
- **Click**: Tap or click on elements
- **Hover**: Hover over elements to trigger effects
- **Scroll**: Navigate through content
- **URL Navigation**: Direct navigation and browser controls
- **App Controls**: Restart and home navigation

### ⌨️ Input & Forms
Handle all types of user input and form interactions.
- **Text Input**: Enter text into fields and forms
- **Keyboard Actions**: Submit forms and special key presses
- **File Uploads**: Handle file selection and upload
- **Numeric Input**: Use keypad for number entry

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
Verify application behavior and extract data for test validation.
- **Assertions**: Verify expected conditions and states
- **Data Extraction**: Capture information from elements
- **Variable Usage**: Use extracted or predefined variables
- **Wait Conditions**: Handle timing and dynamic content
- **Components**: Reusable test sequences

## Getting Started with Interactions

1. **Plan your test flow**: Identify the user journey you want to test
2. **Choose appropriate interactions**: Select from the categories above
3. **Use variables**: Leverage data extraction and variable usage for dynamic tests
4. **Add assertions**: Verify expected outcomes at key points
5. **Handle timing**: Use wait conditions for dynamic content

## Best Practices

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic navigation and input interactions
- **Use assertions frequently**: Verify state at each critical step
- **Extract dynamic data**: Use variables for data that changes between test runs
- **Handle edge cases**: Test offline scenarios and error conditions
- **Organize with components**: Create reusable interaction sequences
