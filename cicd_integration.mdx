## What is CI/CD and Why Does It Matter?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment**—it's the practice of automatically testing and deploying code changes.

Let's break down what this means in plain language:

### Continuous Integration (CI)

**Traditional approach**: Developers work on features for weeks, then try to merge everything together. Often, things break because changes conflict with each other.

**Continuous Integration**: Developers integrate (merge) their code changes frequently—multiple times per day. Every time code is merged, automated tests run to catch problems immediately.

**Analogy**: Instead of writing an entire book and checking for typos at the end (overwhelming!), you check each page as you write it (manageable!).

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Traditional approach**: After testing, someone manually deploys the code to production—copying files, restarting servers, hoping nothing goes wrong.

**Continuous Deployment**: Code that passes all tests automatically deploys to production. No manual steps, no human error.

**Analogy**: Instead of manually mailing each customer their order, you have an automated system that ships orders as soon as they're processed.

### Why This Matters for Testing

Without CI/CD:
- Tests are run manually (slow, easy to forget)
- Broken code can sit undetected for days
- Deployments are risky and stressful

With CI/CD:
- Tests run automatically on every code change
- Problems are caught within minutes
- Deployments become boring and routine (which is good!)

## How Autonoma Fits Into CI/CD

Your development workflow probably looks something like this:

1. Developer writes code
2. Developer creates a Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request
3. **← Autonoma runs tests here**
4. Code review happens
5. Code merges to main branch
6. **← Autonoma runs tests here**
7. Code deploys to production
8. **← Autonoma runs tests here**

By integrating Autonoma at these checkpoints, you catch issues before they reach users.

## Prerequisites

### Generate your API Key

Go to the API Keys section in your Autonoma dashboard and generate a key. You will see something like this once done.

![API key generation demonstration](https://cdn.autonoma.app/images/ci-cd-integrations.gif)

You'll need:
- **Client ID**: Your unique identifier
- **Client Secret**: Your secret key (keep this secure!)

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is GitHub's built-in automation platform. If your code is on GitHub, this is the easiest option.

#### Step 1: Go to Settings > [Integrations](https://autonoma.app/settings/integrations) in your Autonoma dashboard.

![Screenshot of integrations settings page](/images/Screenshot2025-06-04at5.10.18PM.png)

#### Step 2: Select the tests or folders that you want to run in your CI, copy the generated action job!

![Generate action template demonstration](/images/generate-action-template.gif)

#### Step 3: Add to GitHub Workflow

Copy the action job configuration from the Integrations page and paste it into your GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

#### Step 4: Set up GitHub Secrets

1. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add your API credentials as secrets:
    - `AUTONOMA_CLIENT_ID`: Your client ID from the API Keys section
    - `AUTONOMA_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your client secret from the API Keys section

```yaml deploy.yml
jobs:
  run_autonoma_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run Autonoma Tests

    steps:
      - name: Run Single Test (cmbi807au0172xv01dqu4drhi)
        id: step-1
        uses: autonoma-ai/actions/test-runner@v1
        with:
          test-id: 'cmbi807au0172xv01dqu4drhi'
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AUTONOMA_CLIENT_ID }}
          client-secret: ${{ secrets.AUTONOMA_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          max-wait-time: '10'
      - name: Show cmbi807au0172xv01dqu4drhi results
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "Test status: ${{ steps.step-1.outputs.final-status }}"
          echo "Message: ${{ steps.step-1.outputs.message }}"
          echo "View results at: ${{ steps.step-1.outputs.url }}"
```

#### Step 5: Customize When Tests Run

The default configuration runs on every push. You can customize this:

**Run on every Pull Request**:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

**Run on every push to main**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

**Run on both PR and push**:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

**Run on schedule** (e.g., nightly):
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Runs at 2 AM UTC every day
```

### How It Works

Once configured:

1. Developer creates a Pull Request
2. GitHub automatically runs your workflow
3. Autonoma receives the request and runs your tests
4. Results appear in the GitHub PR:
    - ✅ Green checkmark if tests pass
    - ❌ Red X if tests fail
5. Team can see test results before merging

**Result**: No broken code reaches your main branch!

## GitLab CI

GitLab CI is GitLab's built-in automation platform. If your code is on GitLab, use this option.

#### Step 1: Go to Settings > [Integrations](https://autonoma.app/settings/integrations) in your Autonoma dashboard.

#### Step 2: Add Credentials to GitLab CI/CD Variables

1. Go to your GitLab project
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **CI/CD**
3. Expand **Variables**
4. Click **Add variable**
5. Key: `CLIENT_ID`, Value: Your Autonoma client ID
6. Key: `CLIENT_SECRET`, Value: Your Autonoma client secret
7. Check **Mask variable** (hides it in logs)
8. Click **Add variable**

#### Step 2: Create GitLab CI Configuration

In your repository, create or edit `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - test

autonoma_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - curl -X POST \
        --silent \
        --retry 3 \
        --retry-connrefused \
        --location "https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/$FOLDER_ID" \
        --header "autonoma-client-id: $CLIENT_ID" \
        --header "autonoma-client-secret: $CLIENT_SECRET" \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" || true
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main
```

👉 Set `FOLDER_ID` as an environment variable in GitLab → Settings → CI/CD → Variables.

### Customizing GitLab CI

**Run only on merge requests**:
```yaml
only:
  - merge_requests
```

**Run different tests on different branches**:
```yaml
smoke_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - curl -X POST ... --location "https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/$SMOKE_FOLDER_ID" ...
  only:
    - merge_requests

regression_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - curl -X POST ... --location "https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/$REGRESSION_FOLDER_ID" ...
  only:
    - main
```

## Bitbucket Pipelines

Bitbucket Pipelines is Bitbucket's built-in automation platform.

#### Step 1: Go to Settings > [Integrations](https://autonoma.app/settings/integrations) in your Autonoma dashboard.

#### Step 2: Add Credentials to Bitbucket Variables

1. Go to your Bitbucket repository
2. Navigate to **Repository settings**
3. Click **Repository variables** (under Pipelines)
4. Click **Add variable**
5. Name: `CLIENT_ID`, Value: Your Autonoma client ID
6. Name: `CLIENT_SECRET`, Value: Your Autonoma client secret
7. Check **Secured** (encrypts the variable)
8. Click **Add**

#### Step 2: Create Bitbucket Pipeline

In your repository, create or edit `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`:

```yaml bitbucket-pipelines.yml
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Deploy
        script:
          - curl -X POST \
              --silent \
              --retry 3 \
              --retry-connrefused \
              --location "https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/$FOLDER_ID" \
              --header "autonoma-client-id: $CLIENT_ID" \
              --header "autonoma-client-secret: $CLIENT_SECRET" \
              --header "Content-Type: application/json" || true

```

👉 Set `FOLDER_ID` in Bitbucket Repository Variables under Repository settings → Pipelines → Repository variables.

## cURL (Universal)

If you use Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, or any other CI/CD system, you can use cURL commands directly.

### What is cURL?

**cURL** is a command-line tool that makes HTTP requests. It's pre-installed on most systems and works everywhere.

Think of it like this: instead of clicking buttons in a web browser, you're telling your computer to visit a URL and perform an action.

### Getting Your cURL Command

You can build the cURL command manually or find it in Autonoma:

1. Log into Autonoma
2. Go to a test or folder
3. Click the three dots menu
4. Select "Get cURL command"
5. Copy the generated command

### cURL Command Structure

Here's a basic cURL command for running tests:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  --silent \
  --retry 3 \
  --retry-connrefused \
  --location 'https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/<folder-id>' \
  --header 'autonoma-client-id: <client-id>' \
  --header 'autonoma-client-secret: <client-secret>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' || true
```

Let's break it down:

- `curl` - The command tool
- `-X POST` - Type of request (POST means we're sending data)
- `--silent` - Don't show progress meter
- `--retry 3` - Retry up to 3 times on failure
- `--retry-connrefused` - Retry on connection refused
- `--location` - Follow redirects
- `--header` - Authentication headers
- `|| true` - Don't fail the pipeline if the command fails

### Running Different Test Groups

**Run tests by folder**:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  --silent \
  --retry 3 \
  --retry-connrefused \
  --location 'https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/<folder-id>' \
  --header 'autonoma-client-id: <client-id>' \
  --header 'autonoma-client-secret: <client-secret>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' || true
```

**Run a single test**:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  --silent \
  --retry 3 \
  --retry-connrefused \
  --location 'https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/test/<test-id>' \
  --header 'autonoma-client-id: <client-id>' \
  --header 'autonoma-client-secret: <client-secret>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' || true
```

### Using cURL in Different CI Systems

#### Jenkins

Add an Execute Shell build step:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  --silent \
  --retry 3 \
  --retry-connrefused \
  --location "https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/$FOLDER_ID" \
  --header "autonoma-client-id: $CLIENT_ID" \
  --header "autonoma-client-secret: $CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" || true
```

#### CircleCI

Add to `.circleci/config.yml`:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Run Autonoma Tests
          command: |
            curl -X POST \
              --silent \
              --retry 3 \
              --retry-connrefused \
              --location "https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/$FOLDER_ID" \
              --header "autonoma-client-id: $CLIENT_ID" \
              --header "autonoma-client-secret: $CLIENT_SECRET" \
              --header "Content-Type: application/json" || true
```

#### Travis CI

Add to `.travis.yml`:
```yaml
script:
  - curl -X POST \
      --silent \
      --retry 3 \
      --retry-connrefused \
      --location "https://api.prod.autonoma.app/v1/run/folder/$FOLDER_ID" \
      --header "autonoma-client-id: $CLIENT_ID" \
      --header "autonoma-client-secret: $CLIENT_SECRET" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" || true
```

## Best Practices for CI/CD Integration

### 1. Run Different Tests at Different Stages

**On Pull Requests** → Run smoke tests (fast feedback)
```
Tags: smoke
Time: ~5 minutes
Purpose: Catch critical breaks quickly
```

**Before Merging** → Run regression tests (thorough check)
```
Tags: regression
Time: ~20 minutes
Purpose: Comprehensive verification
```

**After Deployment** → Run smoke tests in production
```
Tags: smoke, production-safe
Time: ~5 minutes
Purpose: Verify deployment succeeded
```

### 2. Fail Fast

Configure your CI/CD to stop if Autonoma tests fail:

```yaml
# Example for GitHub Actions
- name: Run Tests
  run: curl ...
  # If curl returns non-zero (test failed), pipeline stops
```

This prevents broken code from being deployed.

### 3. Set Up Notifications

Configure notifications so the team knows when tests fail:

**In Autonoma**:
1. Go to Integrations
2. Set up Slack notifications
3. Choose which failures to notify about

**In Your CI/CD System**:
Most platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) automatically notify on pipeline failures.

### 4. Use Descriptive Job Names

**Bad**:
```yaml
- name: Tests
```

**Good**:
```yaml
- name: Autonoma Smoke Tests - Authentication and Checkout
```

When tests fail, the job name tells you what broke.

### 5. Don't Over-Test

You don't need to run your entire test suite on every single change.

**Smart approach**:
- Every PR: Smoke tests (5-10 critical tests)
- Before merge: Regression tests (all tests)
- Nightly: Regression tests (catches accumulated issues)
- After deploy: Smoke tests (verification)

## Troubleshooting CI/CD Integration

### Tests aren't running

**Check**:
- Is your API token correct?
- Is the token properly stored as a secret/variable?
- Is the workflow/pipeline file in the correct location?
- Are you triggering the right events (PR, push, etc.)?

### Tests run but always fail

**Check**:
- Do tests pass when run manually in Autonoma?
- Is the test environment accessible from CI/CD?
- Are there environment-specific issues (URLs, credentials)?

### CI/CD times out waiting for tests

**Check**:
- Are you running too many tests? Run fewer tests more frequently
- Is there a timeout configuration in your CI/CD? Increase it
- Are tests stuck on a loading state? Add better waits

### Don't see test results in CI/CD

**Check**:
- Is the cURL command configured to show output?
- Are you checking the right logs/build output?
- Is Autonoma receiving the request? (Check Autonoma dashboard)

## Key Takeaways

1. **CI/CD automates test execution** - no manual test running required
2. **Catch bugs before they reach users** - tests run automatically on code changes
3. **Multiple integration options** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket, cURL
4. **Run different tests at different stages** - smoke tests for speed, regression for thoroughness
5. **Fail fast** - stop the pipeline if critical tests fail
6. **Smart testing strategy** - don't run all tests everywhere, be strategic

This ensures your CI/CD pipeline can **trigger the API** reliably. 🚀
