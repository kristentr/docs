## The Problem with Traditional Testing

Testing your application the way real users experience it shouldn't require a computer science degree. Yet traditional e2e testing tools force you to write complex code, manage brittle selectors, and constantly fix tests that break whenever your UI changes.

**The result?** Teams either skip e2e testing entirely (risky!) or waste countless hours maintaining a fragile test suite.

## How Autonoma Solves This

Autonoma brings AI-powered testing to everyone—designers, product managers, QA professionals, and developers. Create robust e2e tests by simply interacting with your application and describing what you want to verify in plain language.

## What Makes Autonoma Different

### 🌐 True Multi-Platform Testing
Test web, iOS, and Android applications using the same simple approach. One tool, one workflow, all platforms.

### ✨ AI-Powered Self-Healing
Your UI changes constantly—buttons move, text updates, layouts shift. Autonoma's AI automatically adapts to these changes, so your tests keep working without manual fixes.

**Traditional tools**: Change a CSS class → 50 tests break → spend hours fixing

**Autonoma**: Change a CSS class → AI adapts → tests keep passing

### 🚀 No Code Required
Describe what you want to test in plain language:
- "Click the checkout button"
- "Verify the order confirmation appears"
- "Wait until the loading spinner disappears"

No selectors, no programming, no problem.

### ⚡ Easy Test Creation
Record tests by clicking through your application naturally. Autonoma watches what you do and converts it into automated tests that run over and over.

**Time to create your first test**: Under 10 minutes

**Time with traditional tools**: Hours or days

## Why Teams Choose Autonoma

**Ship with Confidence** - Catch bugs before they reach users. Automated tests run on every code change.

**Move Faster** - Create tests in minutes, not hours. Everyone on your team can contribute to quality, not just developers.

**Reduce Maintenance** - Self-healing tests adapt to UI changes automatically. Spend less time fixing broken tests.
