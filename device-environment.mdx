## Set Camera Image

**Description**: Mock camera input

Provides mock camera input by setting a predefined image. Useful for testing camera-based features. For the time being, it is only supported in Android devices.

**Examples:**
- set-camera-image https://example.com/image.jpg

---

## Go Offline

**Description**: Simulate offline mode

Simulates loss of network connectivity, allowing testing of offline functionality and error handling.

**Examples:**
- Test offline error messages
- Verify cached content display
- Check offline form submission

---

## Go Online

**Description**: Restore online connection

Restores network connectivity after simulating offline mode, allowing testing of reconnection behavior.

**Examples:**
- Restore network connection
- Test data synchronization on reconnect
- Verify online functionality resume

---

## Zoom In

**Description**: Adjust viewport zoom

Adjusts the browser or app viewport zoom level. Useful for testing responsive design and accessibility features.

**Examples:**
- Zoom in to 125% for better focus

---

## Zoom Out

**Description**: Adjust viewport zoom

Adjusts the browser or app viewport zoom level. Useful for testing responsive design and accessibility features.

**Examples:**
- Zoom out to 75% for better overview

## Testing Scenarios

### Network Connectivity Testing
1. Start with online state
2. Perform actions that require network
3. Go offline
4. Assert appropriate offline behavior
5. Go online
6. Assert reconnection and data sync

### Camera Functionality Testing
1. Navigate to camera feature
2. Set camera image with test image
3. Trigger camera capture
4. Assert image is processed correctly

### Responsive Design Testing
1. Start at normal zoom level
2. Zoom in to test high zoom accessibility
3. Assert content remains readable and functional
4. Zoom out to test overview layouts
5. Assert responsive breakpoints work correctly

## Usage Tips

- **Offline testing**: Essential for mobile apps and PWAs
- **Camera simulation**: Test image processing without physical camera
- **Zoom testing**: Verify accessibility compliance and responsive design
- **Network state changes**: Test how your app handles connection drops and restores
- **Device-specific features**: Some interactions may be platform-specific

## Platform Considerations

### Android-Specific
- Camera image simulation currently only supported on Android
- Test device-specific UI patterns and behaviors

### Web Browsers
- Network state simulation works across all browser platforms
- Zoom controls test responsive design breakpoints

### iOS
- Camera simulation coming soon
- Test iOS-specific interaction patterns
