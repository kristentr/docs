## The Nightmare Scenario

Your company just changed the staging environment URL. It went from `https://staging.yourapp.com` to `https://staging-v2.yourapp.com`.

You have 50 tests. Every single one starts with:
```
1. Navigate to https://staging.yourapp.com/...
```

Now you need to update all 50 tests. One by one. Open each test. Find the URL. Change it. Save. Repeat 49 more times.

**This takes hours.** And it's not the last time this will happen. URLs change. Test credentials rotate. API endpoints update. Every change means touching dozens of tests.

There's a better way. One that lets you change a value once and instantly update all 50 tests. It's called **variables**, and once you understand them, you'll never go back.

## What Are Variables?

Variables are values you define once and reuse across all your tests.

Instead of hardcoding `https://staging.yourapp.com` in 50 tests, you create a variable called `APP_URL` and set it to `https://staging.yourapp.com`. Then every test references `{{variable:APP_URL}}`.

When you need to change the URL, you update the variable once. All 50 tests automatically use the new value.

**Think of variables like a company-wide contact list.** Instead of everyone memorizing phone numbers, you maintain one list. When a number changes, you update the list once, and everyone gets the new number.

## Your First Variable

Let's create and use a variable in a test.

**Step 1: Define the variable**

In Autonoma, go to your project settings and create a new variable:
- Name: `TEST_EMAIL`
- Value: `test.user@example.com`

This creates a variable you can use in any test.

**Step 2: Use it in a test**

Build a login test using the variable:

```
Test: "Login with test account"

1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/login
2. Wait until: Login form loads
3. Type {{variable:TEST_EMAIL}} in email field
4. Type {{variable:TEST_PASSWORD}} in password field
5. Click "Sign In"
6. Wait until: Dashboard loads
```

Notice `{{variable:TEST_EMAIL}}` and `{{variable:TEST_PASSWORD}}`—these reference your variables. When the test runs, Autonoma replaces them with the actual values.

**Step 3: The magic happens**

Now imagine your test email needs to change. Maybe the old one is blocked, or you need a different domain.

**Without variables**: Open all 50 tests that use this email. Change it in each one. Save each one.

**With variables**: Change `TEST_EMAIL` once in project settings. Done. All 50 tests instantly use the new email.

## Common Variables to Create

Here are the variables most teams set up first:

**Environment URLs**:
```
{{variable:APP_URL}} = https://staging.yourapp.com
{{variable:API_URL}} = https://api.staging.yourapp.com
{{variable:ADMIN_URL}} = https://admin.staging.yourapp.com
```

Use these in every navigation step. When you switch environments (staging → production), change the variables once.

**Test credentials**:
```
{{variable:TEST_EMAIL}} = test.user@example.com
{{variable:TEST_PASSWORD}} = SecurePass123!
{{variable:ADMIN_EMAIL}} = admin@example.com
{{variable:ADMIN_PASSWORD}} = AdminPass456!
```

Use these for all login tests. When credentials rotate, update once.

**API keys and tokens**:
```
{{variable:API_KEY}} = sk_test_abc123xyz789
{{variable:STRIPE_KEY}} = pk_test_def456
```

Use these for API integrations. When keys change, update once.

**Test data**:
```
{{variable:VALID_ZIP_CODE}} = 94105
{{variable:TEST_PHONE}} = +1-555-0123
{{variable:PROMO_CODE}} = TESTCODE2024
```

Use these for form testing. When test data needs updating, change once.

## Real-World Example: Multi-Environment Testing

Let's see how variables make multi-environment testing manageable.

**Your test**:
```
Test: "Complete checkout flow"

1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/products
2. Wait until: Products load
3. Add prompt: "Click the first product"
4. Click "Add to Cart"
5. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/cart
6. Click "Checkout"
7. Type {{variable:TEST_EMAIL}} in email field
8. Type {{variable:TEST_ADDRESS}} in address field
9. Type {{variable:TEST_ZIP}} in zip code field
10. Click "Complete Purchase"
11. Wait until: Confirmation page appears
```

**Staging environment variables**:
```
APP_URL = https://staging.yourapp.com
TEST_EMAIL = staging.test@example.com
TEST_ADDRESS = 123 Test St
TEST_ZIP = 94105
```

**Production environment variables**:
```
APP_URL = https://yourapp.com
TEST_EMAIL = prod.test@example.com
TEST_ADDRESS = 456 Prod Ave
TEST_ZIP = 10001
```

Same test. Different variables. Runs perfectly in both environments. **No test changes needed.**

## Variables vs Hardcoding

Let's see the difference side by side.

**Hardcoded test (bad)**:
```
Test: "User registration"

1. Navigate to https://staging.yourapp.com/signup
2. Type john.smith.test@gmail.com in email field
3. Type Password123! in password field
4. Type Password123! in confirm password field
5. Click "Sign Up"
```

**Problems**:
- URL is hardcoded (breaks when URL changes)
- Email is hardcoded (might get reused, causing conflicts)
- Password is visible (security issue)
- Every test like this needs individual updates

**Variable-based test (good)**:
```
Test: "User registration"

1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/signup
2. Type {{variable:TEST_EMAIL}} in email field
3. Type {{variable:TEST_PASSWORD}} in password field
4. Type {{variable:TEST_PASSWORD}} in confirm password field
5. Click "Sign Up"
```

**Benefits**:
- URL is centrally managed
- Email can be changed once for all tests
- Password is stored securely in project settings
- One change updates all tests

## When to Use Variables

Use variables for any value that:

**Changes occasionally**:
- URLs (environments change)
- Credentials (passwords rotate)
- API keys (keys expire)

**Appears in multiple tests**:
- Common email addresses
- Shared phone numbers
- Standard test data

**Should be configurable**:
- Environment-specific settings
- Feature flags
- Regional data (zip codes, phone formats)

**Needs security**:
- Passwords
- API tokens
- Private keys

## Variables for Different User Roles

Many apps have different user types. Use variables to test each role:

**Customer role**:
```
{{variable:CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} = customer@example.com
{{variable:CUSTOMER_PASSWORD}} = CustomerPass123!
```

**Admin role**:
```
{{variable:ADMIN_EMAIL}} = admin@example.com
{{variable:ADMIN_PASSWORD}} = AdminPass123!
```

**Merchant role**:
```
{{variable:MERCHANT_EMAIL}} = merchant@example.com
{{variable:MERCHANT_PASSWORD}} = MerchantPass123!
```

Then create tests for each role:

```
Test: "Customer can view orders"

1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/login
2. Type {{variable:CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} in email field
3. Type {{variable:CUSTOMER_PASSWORD}} in password field
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/orders
6. Wait until: Order history loads
```

```
Test: "Admin can manage users"

1. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/admin
2. Type {{variable:ADMIN_EMAIL}} in email field
3. Type {{variable:ADMIN_PASSWORD}} in password field
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Navigate to {{variable:APP_URL}}/admin/users
6. Wait until: User management panel loads
```

## Tips for Organizing Variables

**Use clear naming conventions**:
```
Good: TEST_EMAIL, APP_URL, STAGING_URL
Bad: EMAIL1, URL, THEURL
```

**Group related variables**:
```
# Environment
APP_URL
API_URL
ADMIN_URL

# Customer credentials
CUSTOMER_EMAIL
CUSTOMER_PASSWORD

# Admin credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL
ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

**Document what each variable is for**:
Add descriptions in your project settings so team members understand each variable's purpose.

## Variables vs Keys vs Random Data

By now you've learned about three types of dynamic values in Autonoma. Here's how they differ:

**Variables** (`{{variable:NAME}}`):
- **You set the value** before tests run
- **Changes manually** when you update project settings
- **Use for**: Credentials, URLs, configuration
- **Example**: `{{variable:TEST_EMAIL}}` = "test@example.com"

**Keys** (`{{key:NAME}}`):
- **Your app generates the value** during the test
- **Extracted during test execution** via extraction steps
- **Use for**: Order numbers, confirmation codes, IDs
- **Example**: `{{key:ORDER_ID}}` = "#A7B3X9" (extracted from app)

**Random data** (`{{random:type}}`):
- **Autonoma generates the value** each test run
- **Changes automatically** every time
- **Use for**: Unique emails, names, data that can't repeat
- **Example**: `{{random:email}}` = "alice.jones.x7k9@example.com"

**When to use which**:
- Need same value in all tests? → Variable
- Need value your app creates? → Key (extraction)
- Need unique value each run? → Random data

## What's Next

You now understand how variables save you hours of test maintenance. Instead of updating values in dozens of tests, you update once and all tests benefit.

But what about when you need *different* values every time? That's where random data comes in—and it solves a problem you might not even know you have.
